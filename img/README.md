A note about images
-------------------

2/16/15

I decided to use (for now) the [BlueImp Bootstrap Image Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery) for our slide show(s).

We require a thumbnail for displaying the gallery contents on the site.  Those dimensions are 150x150 and are easily created in photoshop.  
Just open an existing thumbnail, drag a new photo onto it, do some slight adjustments, and save.

I know I'll forget all this, so I wanted to get it down here.

Happy working!
